        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Hao Ran, and my English name is Felix. I was born in 2005 in Beijing, China. As a passionate student currently studying Business Economics at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), my academic journey began with a strong interest in economics, which drives me to seek a deeper understanding and application of the subject. My studies at UCR have exposed me to a wealth of economic theories and practices, allowing me to gradually master the ability to analyze market dynamics and consumer behavior through courses such as microeconomics, macroeconomics, statistics, and marketing.

I not only focus on accumulating theoretical knowledge but also actively participate in various campus activities and projects to enhance my practical skills. During my time at UCR, I worked as a research assistant in the Business Economics department, assisting professors with the construction of economic models and data analysis. This experience provided me with a deeper understanding of how to apply theory in practice, while also honing my data processing and analytical skills. Additionally, I am a member of the campus Economics Club, where I help organize lectures and seminars to promote academic exchange among students. Through these activities, I have improved my organizational and communication skills, while also making many like-minded friends.<br><br>

        Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for music and sports. As a rap enthusiast, I enjoy expressing myself through music. I create and perform my own works, participating in various small music events to showcase my talents. Music is not just a hobby for me; it is a way to release emotions and thoughts. Through rap, I can express my views on life, society, and personal experiences, sharing my stories. This creative process not only brings me joy but also helps me develop my creativity and self-confidence.

In terms of sports, my love for football and table tennis has been growing. Football has taught me the importance of teamwork; through harmonious collaboration with my teammates, we pursue the common goal of victory. Table tennis has improved my quick reflexes and skill application. Engaging in these two sports has not only enhanced my physical fitness but also reinforced the significance of perseverance and effort.

In my personal life, I actively engage in volunteer work, having served as a volunteer at a community service center in Beijing. By assisting in organizing community activities, I have come to deeply appreciate the importance of caring for others and giving back to society. This experience has made me realize that everyone can bring positive change to those around them through their efforts. I hope to continue making a difference in the business field, applying my knowledge to benefit society.<br><br>

        Looking to the future, I aspire to make my mark in the field of business economics, particularly in market research and economic analysis. I believe that the knowledge and skills I have acquired at UCR will enable me to provide valuable insights and solutions for businesses. While seeking internship opportunities, I look forward to applying the theoretical knowledge learned in class to real-world business environments, further enhancing my capabilities.

At the same time, I hope to continually improve my music creation skills, exploring different styles and sharing my thoughts and emotions with a wider audience. I believe that the combination of music and business economics will open up broader pathways for me, allowing me to create unique value in my career.

In summary, I am an optimistic and passionate young person who firmly believes that effort and enthusiasm can change everything. I look forward to continuously learning and growing in the days ahead, pursuing my dreams and realizing my personal value.
